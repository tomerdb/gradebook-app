git commit -m "Ready for Render.com deployment"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/grade-book-app.git

## ⚠️ Important Notes:

### Free Tier Limitations:
- Services sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity
- Cold start can take 30+ seconds
- SQLite database is ephemeral (resets on restart)
- 750 hours/month limit

### Database Consideration:
For production use, consider:
- Upgrading to paid plan for persistent storage
- Using external database (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Regular backups if using SQLite

### Monitoring:
- Check Render dashboard for service status
- Monitor logs for any deployment issues
- Test all features after deployment

## 🔧 If Issues Occur:

1. **CORS Errors**: Update the frontend URL in `backend/app.js` CORS settings
2. **Service Won't Start**: Check logs in Render dashboard
3. **API Not Found**: Verify the API base URL in frontend matches your backend URL
4. **Database Issues**: Remember data resets on free tier restarts

✅ Course management and enrollment
✅ Evaluation creation and grading
✅ PDF export for gradesheets
✅ CSV export for reports
